A BASH console utility that processes command line arguments and performs some actions.
  1. For the -u and --users arguments, outputs a list of users and their home directories to the screen, sorted alphabetically;
  2. For the -p and --processes arguments, outputs a list of running processes, sorted by their ID;
  3. For the -h and --help arguments, outputs help with a list and description of arguments and stops work;
  4. For the -l PATH and –log PATH arguments, replaces output to the screen with output to a file at the specified PATH path;
  5. For the -e PATH and –errors PATH arguments, replaces error output from the stderr stream to a file at the specified PATH path.

Notes:
  1. Command line arguments must be processed using the "getopt" or "getopts" mechanisms.
  2. Each type of action must be processed in a separate function.
  3. The program must check access to the path and output appropriate error messages. The program must filter or process the outputs in stderr of the commands used.
